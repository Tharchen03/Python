# Built-in Math Functions
# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

x = min(2,10,15)
y = max(2,10,15)

print(x)
print(y)

# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
z = abs(-40.4)
print(z)

# The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).
# Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):
p1 = pow(4,3)
print(p1)

p = pow(5,2)
print(p)

# The Math Module
# Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.
# To use it, you must import the math module:

import math

num = math.sqrt(25)
print(num)

# The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

up = math.ceil(1.2) # upwards
dw = math.floor(1.8) # downwards
print(up)
print(dw)
